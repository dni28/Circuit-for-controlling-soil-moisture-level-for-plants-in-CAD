This project presents a smart irrigation system designed to automate watering based on real-time soil moisture levels. Using resistive moisture sensors, operational amplifiers (OpAmps), and a relay modeled as a resistor, the system intelligently activates a water pump when the soil becomes too dry and deactivates it once the desired humidity is reached.
